The program plays you an interval, an interval string, or a chord and you type in what was played. This program does not make sound itself. It sends midi notes to another program or instrument which makes sound.

For intervals, we use these answers:
m2 M2 m3 M3 P4 TT P5 m6 M6 m7 M7 P8

For chords, we use these answers:
M M6 M64 m m6 m64 o6 + Mm7 M7 m7 o/7 o7 Mm65 M65 m65 o/65 and so on.
o/7 is half diminished

The user may specify any set of chords to use with this program.

If this program does not work, read the instructions again, and make sure you are doing everything correctly. After doing that you can ask the author for help, but he may not have time. If you want help, the best thing to do is to bring your computer to the author while at school or whatever.

You first enter a number corresponding to the midi bus to your daw or sound making program. Then you choose an activity. If you choose chord identification you need to specify a chord csv file which contains the chords you wish to be tested on. If you choose interval identification you need to specify an interval csv file. The program comes with two csv files, sevenths.csv, which contains all the seventh chords in all inversions and allints.csv which includes all intervals an octave or smaller.

You can copy and modify these csv file to use different sets of chords and intervals. The allints.csv is just a one-line list of comma-separated intervals which you may remove intervals from. The sevenths.csv is a comma-separated list of chords. Each line in sevenths.csv starts with the answer string (e.g., Mm7, but it could be anything; if you prefer "MajMin7" you could write that instead) for a chord, and is followed by a list of the intervals (in semitones) which make up that chord. For example, the entry for a major chord would be "M,4,3" without quotes. You should make copies of these files if you modify them, so that you can always go back to the original files if your modifications cause the program to stop working.
